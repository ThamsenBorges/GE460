The rules of the game are that you and your enemy blue ship chasing you both have 2 hit points. Make sure it dies first to win. 
I initally wanted it so you had to shoot the incoming rocks and your enemy but I could not figure out the mechanics of it and I think it was because the assets were not good enough.
So I made it a sort of survive or die game. There were a lot of limitaions in the playground assets which made it harder to do what I wanted, but it is a game because there in an objective
and you are in control.
Feeback from my friends were that it was very simple but could be a good level in a game of full of these kind scenarios with some things added.

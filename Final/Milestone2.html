			Premise
		</h2>
		<p> A dense downtown city street becomes corrupted, luring the character, equipped only with a pistol to the source.</p>
			<p> After discovering the source of corruption, it becomes truly unleashed, and the player must flee with the newly acquired grappling hook as the corruption quickly attempts to envelop them.</p>
			<p> After making it back where they started and acquiring a new weapon capable of destroying the all-encompassing terrain the corruption has spread across the city, the player must fight back to the source to destroy it.</p>
		</section>

		<h2>
			Purpose
		</h2>
		<p> To deeply couple the player's mood to the pace of each level by, at first, enforcing firm limits on movement and damage, but then utilizing the sharp spikes in unlocked potential to guide the player's sense of tense urgency, and then their powerful catharsis.</p>

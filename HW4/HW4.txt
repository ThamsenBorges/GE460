The video of Edmund McMillen talking about his games he was a part of was very cool. I had seen a lot of Meat Boy and Isaac from things online and my friends playing them. I also was very surprised he made games on NewGrounds which is a name I have not heard since I was like 12. I used to play a lot of flash games when I was a kid and my friend Michael and I would play on NewGrounds all the time. Edmund’s games are sort of simple compared to the large game genre these days but his character design as well as his levels, and stories make his games feel a lot more than they are. He brought a lot of personal events and emotions into his gamedesign. He also mentioned the Indie game boom and the movie that was made, as an Xbox gamer at like 13 years old the Indie game boom was wild to be a part of as a player. Everyone was playing whatever Indie was popular that week. At the time I of course did not understand what it really meant, but I think looking back now it opened the door for so many people and companies to make successful games. It reminds me of the Early Access boom on steam where these lesser funded people and developers release an early playable version of their game then use the funds from people buying it to hopefully finish it. However this has been a large problem recently with games not being finished and people abusing the system to make money without giving their customers a game worth buying. The story of Tetris was all new too me, of course I have played and know of tetris who hasn’t. I did not know it was Russian made, Soviet Russian rather.

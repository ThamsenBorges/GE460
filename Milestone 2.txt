 Premise: A dense downtown city street becomes corrupted, luring the character to the source. An explosive event forces them into a fast-paced flight, and then to regroup and reclaim the street.
Game purpose: To give the player a latent/buildup phase, a flight section, and a cathartic fight section through enhanced movement mechanics (grapple hook, fast-paced/high-stakes enemies)
Platform: PC
